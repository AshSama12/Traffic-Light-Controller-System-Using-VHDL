# Traffic Light Controller System Using VHDL 🚦

This project implements a **Traffic Light Controller System** designed to manage pedestrian and vehicle traffic at a highway-hospital intersection. Developed using **VHDL**, the system ensures pedestrian safety and prioritizes hospital road vehicles, adhering to modern traffic management requirements.

## 📋 Project Overview

- **Scenario:** 
  - Pedestrian crossing on a highway intersects with a hospital road.
  - Vehicles from the hospital road have priority.
  - Traffic light turns red for pedestrians after 20 seconds if they are waiting.
- **Objective:** 
  - Design a reliable, efficient, and safe traffic light controller using VHDL.
  - Ensure smooth traffic flow while maintaining pedestrian safety.

## 🛠️ Features

- **Priority Management:** Hospital vehicles are given precedence over pedestrian crossings.
- **Timed State Transitions:** Traffic lights operate with precise timing to control transitions between green, yellow, and red lights.
- **Pedestrian Safety:** Lights turn red after 20 seconds of pedestrian waiting.
- **Real-Time Simulation:** Tested and validated using Quartus simulation tools.
